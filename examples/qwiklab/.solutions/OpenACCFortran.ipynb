With OpenACC directives, you provide *hints* via compiler directives to tell the compiler where -- and how -- it should parallelize compute-intensive code for execution on an accelerator. \n\nIf you've done parallel programming using OpenMP, OpenACC is very similar: using directives, applications can be parallelized *incrementally*, with little or no change to the Fortran or C source. Debugging and code maintenance are easier. OpenACC directives are designed for *portability* across operating systems, host CPUs, and accelerators. You can use OpenACC directives with GPU accelerated libraries, explicit parallel programming languages (e.g., CUDA), MPI, and OpenMP, *all in the same program.*\n\nWatch the following short video introduction to OpenACC:\n\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" style=\"margin: 0 auto;\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/c9WYCFEt_Uo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nThis hands-on lab walks you through a short sample of a scientific code, and demonstrates how you can employ OpenACC directives using a four-step process. You will make modifications to a simple Fortran program, then compile and execute the newly enhanced code in each step. Along the way, hints and solution are provided, so you can check your work, or take a peek if you get lost.\n\nIf you are confused now, or at any point in this lab, you can consult the <a href=\"#FAQ\">FAQ</a> located at the bottom of this page."

Characterize your application\n2. Add compute directives\n3. Minimize data movement\n4. Optimize kernel scheduling\n\nThe content of these steps and their order will be familiar if you have ever done parallel programming on other platforms. Parallel programmers deal with the same issues whenever they tackle a new set of code, no matter what platform they are parallelizing an application for. These issues include:\n\n+ optimizing and benchmarking the serial version of an application\n+ profiling to identify the compute-intensive portions of the program that can be executed concurrently\n+ expressing concurrency using a parallel programming notation (e.g., OpenACC directives)\n+ compiling and benchmarking each new/parallel version of the application\n+ locating problem areas and making improvements iteratively until the target level of performance is reached\n\nThe programming manual for some other parallel platform you've used may have suggested five steps, or fifteen. Whether you are an expert or new to parallel programming, we recommend that you walk through the four steps here as a good way to begin accelerating applications by at least 2X using OpenACC directives. We believe *being more knowledgeable about the four steps* will make the process of programming for an accelerator more understandable *and* more manageable. The 2X in 4 Steps process will help you use OpenACC on your own codes more productively, and get significantly better speed-ups in less time."

If your program is not highly parallel, an accelerator or coprocesor won't be much use. Understanding the code structure is crucial if you are going to *identify opportunities* and *successfully* parallelize a piece of code. The first step in OpenACC programming then is to *characterize the application*. This includes:\n\n+ benchmarking the single-thread, CPU-only version of the application\n+ understanding the program structure and how data is passed through the call tree\n+ profiling the application and identifying computationally-intense \"hot spots\"\n    + which loop nests dominate the runtime?\n    + what are the minimum/average/maximum tripcounts through these loop nests?\n    + are the loop nests suitable for an accelerator?\n+ insuring that the algorithms you are considering for acceleration are *safely* parallel\n\nNote: what we've just said may sound a little scary, so please note that as parallel programming methods go OpenACC is really pretty friendly: think of it as a sandbox you can play in. Because OpenACC directives are incremental, you can add one or two in at a time and see how things work: the compiler provides a *lot* of feedback. The right software plus good tools plus educational experiences like this one should put you on the path to successfully accelerating your programs.\n\nWe will be accelerating a 2D-stencil called the Jacobi Iteration.

It doesn't do you any good to make an application run faster if it does not return the correct results.  It is thus very important to have a quality check built into your application before you start accelerating or optimizing.  This can be a simple value print out (one you can compare to a non-accelerated version of the algorithm) or something else.\n\nIn our case, on every 100th iteration of the outer `while` loop, we print the current max error. (You just saw an example when we executed *task1_pre_out*.) As we add directives to accelerate our code later in this lab, you can look back at these values to verify that we're getting the correct answer.  These print-outs also help us verify that we are converging on a solution -- which means that we should see that, as we proceed, the values are approaching zero.\n\n**Note:** NVIDIA GPUs implement IEEE-754 compliant floating point arithmetic just like most modern CPUs. However, because floating point arithmetic is not associative, the order of operations can affect the rounding error inherent with floating-point operations: you may not get exactly the same answer when you move to a different processor. Therefore, you'll want to make sure to verify your answer within an acceptable error bound. Please read [this](https://developer.nvidia.com/content/precision-performance-floating-point-and-ieee-754-compliance-nvidia-gpus) article at a later time, if you would like more details.\n\n*After each step*, we will record the results from our benchmarking and correctness tests in a table like this one: \n\n|Step| Execution       | ExecutionTime (s)     | Speedup vs. 1 CPU Thread       | Correct? | Programming Time |\n|:--:| --------------- | ---------------------:| ------------------------------:|:--------:| -----------------|\n|1   | CPU 1 thread    | 1.137            |                                | Yes      |                |  |\n\n*Note: Problem Size: 1024 x 1024; System Information: GK104; Compiler: PGI 14.1*\n\n(The execution times quoted will be times we got running on our GK104 -- your times throughout the lab may vary for one reason or another.)\n\nYou may also want to track how much time you spend porting your application, step by step, so a column has been included for recording time spent."

Your objective in the step after this one (Step 2) will be to modify `task2.f90` in a way that moves the most computationally intensive, independent loops to the accelerator. With a simple code, you can identify which loops are candidates for acceleration with a little bit of code inspection. On more complex codes, a great way to find these computationally intense areas is to use a profiler (such as PGI's PGPROF or open-source `gprof`) to determine which functions are consuming the largest amounts of compute time.

For example, each of the following code samples instructs the compiler to generate a kernel -- from suitable loops -- for execution on an accelerator:\n\n    !$acc kernels\n    \n        // accelerate suitable loops here \n    \n    !$acc end kernels\n    // but not these loops\n\nor\n\n    !$acc kernels\n    \n    do i=2, NN-1\n    \n         // body of do-loop\n         ... // The do-loop is a structured block, so this code will be accelerated\n         \n    end do\n    \n    !$end kernels\n    \n         ... // Any code here will not be accelerated since it is outside of the do-loop"

The line starting with `24, Loop is parallelizable` of the output tells us that on line `24` in our source, an accelerated kernel was generated.  This is the the loop just after where we put our first `!$acc kernels`.\n4. The following lines provide more details on the accelerator kernel on line 24.  It shows we created a parallel OpenACC `loop`. This loop is made up of gangs (a grid of blocks in CUDA language) and vector parallelism (threads in CUDA language) with the vector size being 128 per gang.\n5. At line 34, the compiler tells us it found another loop to accelerate.\n6. The rest of the information concerns data movement which we'll get into later in this lab.\n\nSo as you can see, lots of useful information is provided by the compiler, and it's very important that you carefuly inspect this information to make sure the compiler is doing what you've asked of it.\n\nFinally, let's execute this program to verify we are getting the correct answer (execute the cell below).

(As in all modern computing, the movement of data is where applications spend most of their time and the host's computing power.)  This problem of copying back and forth on every iteration of a loop is sometimes called \"data sloshing\".\n\nThe OpenACC compiler can only work with the information we have given it.  It knows we need the `A` and `Anew` arrays on the GPU for each of our two accelerated sections, but we didn't tell it anything about what happens to the data outside of those sections.  Without this knowledge, it has to copy the full arrays *to the GPU and back to the CPU* for each accelerated section, *every time* it went through the while loop.  That is a LOT of wasted data transfers.\n\nIdeally, we would just transfer `A` and `Anew` to the GPU at the beginning of the Jacobi Iteration, and then only transfer `A` back to the CPU at the end.\n\nBecause overall accelerator performance is detetermined largely by how well memory transfers are optimized, the OpenACC specification defines the `data` directive and several modifying clauses to manage all the various forms of data movement."

We are going to do this with the OpenACC `data` directive and some modifying clauses defined in the OpenACC specification. \n\nIn Fortran, the `data` directive applies to the next structured code block.  The compiler will manage data according to the provided clauses.  It does this at the beginning of the `data` directive code block, and then again at the end.  Some of the clauses available for use with the `data` directive are:\n\n* `copy( list )` - Allocates memory on GPU and copies data from host to GPU when entering region and copies data to the host when exiting region.\n* `copyin( list )` - Allocates memory on GPU and copies data from host to GPU when entering region.\n* `copyout( list )` - Allocates memory on GPU and copies data to the host when exiting region.\n* `create( list )` - Allocates memory on GPU but does not copy.\n* `present( list )` - Data is already present on GPU from another containing data region.\n\nAs an example, the following directive copies array A to the GPU at the beginning of the code block, and back to the CPU at the end.  It also copies arrays B and C *to the CPU* at the *end* of the code block, but does **not** copy them both to the GPU at the beginning:\n\n<pre><code>\n   !$acc data copy( A ), copyout( B, C )\n\n   ....\n   !$acc end data\n</code></pre>\n\nFor detailed information on the `data` directive clauses, you can refer to the OpenACC [1.0](http://www.openacc.org/sites/default/files/OpenACC.1.0_0.pdf) or [2.0](http://www.openacc.org/sites/default/files/OpenACC%202%200.pdf) specifications.\n\nIn the text editor below, see if you can add in a `data` directive to minimize data transfers in the Jacobi Iteration. There's a place for  the `create` clause in this exercise too.   As usual, there are some hints provided, and you can look at task3_solution.f90 to see the answer if you get stuck or want to check your work.  **Don't forget to save with File -> Save in the editor below before moving on.**"

The grid the compiler has constructed is also 2D, 8 blocks wide and 1022 blocks tall. This is just enough to cover our 1024x1024 grid.

When you decide to intervene, think about different parallelization strategies (loop schedules): in nested loops, distributing the work of the outer loops to the GPU multiprocessors (on PGI = gangs) in 1D grids. Similarly, think about mapping the work of the inner loops to the cores of the multiprocessors (CUDA threads, vectors)  in 1D blocks.
